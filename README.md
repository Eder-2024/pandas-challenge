Analysis
This Notebook examines the performance of 15 schools , taking into consideration just 2 types of public school , charter and district. Also analizes some key factors like school size, spending per student,  student math  scores , reading scores and passing rates.

Conclusions:
 1. Charter schools provide a more effective learning environment than district schools, leading to significantly better student outcomes.For example       Charter schools constantly demonstrate higher average math and reading scores, higher passing rates in both. This can be visually seen in the table     "Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)" where only Charter schools are on the top.
 2. There is a stronger correlation between school size and overall performance, the correlation between both factors is -0.84. For instance medium and     smaller schools (under 2000 students) show the highest overall performance across all metrics.
